  "description": "WETC is the wrapped version of EthereumClassic. \nWrapped coins solve a particular problem: because of the low interoperability of blockchains, native coins of one chain cannot be used on another chain. Wrapping coins solves this problem by tokenizing them applying the blockchainâ€™s token standard to the tokenized version of the original cryptocurrency. "
